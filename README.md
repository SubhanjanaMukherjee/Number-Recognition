# Number-Recognition
A neural network-based system for detecting and recognizing handwritten digits from scanned images. This project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The code preprocesses the data, trains a neural network model, and achieves accurate recognition of handwritten digits. This project serves as a practical implementation of neural networks in the field of image classification and can be a valuable resource for learning and exploring handwritten digit recognition.
